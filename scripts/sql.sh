# ADVANCED / OPTIONAL. Peek at the raw Temporal database — the durable state behind your
# workflow. The Web UI is the primary tool; this is for advanced users who want to see the
# storage itself (e.g. the append-only history ledger in Lab 4).
#   Usage:  ./scripts/sql.sh [q1|q2|q3|all] [workflow-id]
#     q1  = state snapshot + version counters (this workflow)
#     q2  = the append-only history ledger (this workflow)
#     q3  = in-flight work across the DB (pending timers/activities/signals)
